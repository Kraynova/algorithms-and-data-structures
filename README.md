# algorithms-and-data-structures
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joisadler/algorithms-and-data-structures.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joisadler/algorithms-and-data-structures)

My own implementation of the algorithms that I am studying.

This library was created only for the purpose of studying. Please do not use it in your production code!


Installation:

`$ npm install --save algorithms-and-data-structures`

Usage:

```javascript
const algs = require('algorithms-and-data-structures');

const arr = [1, 3, 2];
console.log(algs.quickSort(arr)); // [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```
